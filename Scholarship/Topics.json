With 15 I developed my first Mac and iOS application. Since then there’s scarcely a day I don’t work anymore. By reading blogs and books I have learnt a handful of programming languages including: <b>Objective-C</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>Ruby</b> and <b>Swift</b>. During my last year of high school I was also working part time at <b>Ubique</b>, a software agency based in Zurich.",
